In this project, we successfully designed a nanoprocessor capable of executing simple, limited instructions. The completed design includes:
             1. A 4-bit Adder/Subtractor unit ( HA, FA )
             2. A 3-bit Adder
             3. A 3-bit Program Counter (PC)
             4. K-way b-bit Multiplexers
             5. A Register Bank
             6. A Program ROM
             7. Buses
             8. An Instruction Decoder
             9. NanoProcessor code
Each component was carefully developed and integrated into the processor. The functionality of the processor was thoroughly tested by programming the Basys 3 board and running various instruction sets from the ROM, confirming that the microprocessor performs as intended.
