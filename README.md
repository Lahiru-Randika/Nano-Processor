In this project, we successfully designed a nanoprocessor capable of executing simple, limited instructions. The completed design includes:
              A 4-bit Adder/Subtractor unit ( HA, FA )
              A 3-bit Adder
              A 3-bit Program Counter (PC)
              K-way b-bit Multiplexers
              A Register Bank
              A Program ROM
              Buses
              An Instruction Decoder
Each component was carefully developed and integrated into the processor. The functionality of the processor was thoroughly tested by programming the Basys 3 board and running various instruction sets from the ROM, confirming that the microprocessor performs as intended.
